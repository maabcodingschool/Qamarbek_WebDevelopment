        <h2>The First Time</h2>
        <p>It’s time to take a new approach. Our earth is heating at an alarming rate, with no sign of slowing down. The past 22 years have been the warmest on record and current efforts to save the environment are not enough. Microsoft has taken an innovative perspective on the issue, funding a $50 million cross-company effort delivering technology-enabled solutions to environmental challenges. Microsoft’s AI for Earth, founded in 2017, is laying the foundations for the world’s first planetary computer, placing global scale data at our fingertips in an effort to solve the crisis. </p>

        <h3>What Is AI and How Does It Work?</h3>
        <p>AI, or artificial intelligence, is essentially an algorithm that solves problems. The simplest form is narrow AI, which is task-oriented and able to do some things better than humans, such as recognizing speech or images or forecasting weather. </p>
